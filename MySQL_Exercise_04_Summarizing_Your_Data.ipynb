    "# MySQL Exercise 4: Summarizing your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week you practiced retrieving and formatting selected subsets of raw data from individual tables in a database.  In this lesson we are going to learn how to use SQL to run calculations that summarize your data without having to output all the raw rows or entries.  These calculations will serve as building blocks for the queries that will address our business questions about how to improve Dognition test completion rates.\n",
